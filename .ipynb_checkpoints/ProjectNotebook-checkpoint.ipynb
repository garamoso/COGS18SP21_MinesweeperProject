    "My project is my take on the popular game, minesweeper. Inputs are integers ONLY, do NOT enter '' or hit the 'Enter' key without an input as it will break the code and end the game. When you start up the game it will ask you for the dimension of the grid the user wishes to play on. The options are: 5 (5x5 grid), 7 (7x7 grid), and 9 (9x9 grid). Then, it will ask you for a row and column input. The first row is represented as '0', NOT '1'! The first column is represented as '0', NOT '1'! The reason I chose to make this game was to challenge my coding abilities and see if I was able to make a functional passtime like minesweeper. Enjoy and have fun :)"
